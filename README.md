# <Node-README-Generator>

## Description

For this assignment i was tasked with creating a README generator that would function on the command line. This project contains several questions that will be prompted to the user, such as what their project title is and what a good description for their project would be, then passes that information through various diffrent functions to construct a well structured README.md file. 

This assignment helped me to better familiarize myself with Node, as well as using classes and static functions.  




## Usage

This application can be run on the command line, and initialized by typing "node .".

A video walkthrough of the apps functionallity can be viewed below. This generated example README file can be viewed in the utils folder, at /utils/READMEexample.md:
